## Node meme scraper

by running

```
node index.js
```

ten memes are scraped from https://memegen-link-examples-upleveled.netlify.app/ and saved in a directory called 'memes'
You can run the program multiple times

by adding three arguments you can create your own custom meme which will be saved as 'custom-meme'. The first argument will be the text at the top of the meme, the second the text on the bottom. The third argument will look for a fitting picture, if no picture is found using your input, you will get a boring grey picture for your meme - sorry :see_no_evil:

For example:

```
node index.js hello karl bender
```
